AUS_ww1_back_ger:0 "Strengthen Ties with Germany"
AUS_ww1_back_ger_desc:0 "Though some of the Austrian aristocrats are still bitter about the German unification process, they are our brothers, and one of the few friendly states to our government still left these days." 

AUS_ww1_military_advisors:0 "Military Expertise from Germany"
AUS_ww1_military_advisors_desc:0 "They say that Prussia was hatched from a cannonball, and while they may not call the country that anymore, the axiom still holds true. Accepting the help of Germany to modernize our military would be an easy benefit to reap from this alliance."

AUS_ww1_back_italy:0 "Securing Italian Loyalty"
AUS_ww1_back_italy_desc:0 "The Italians are, to say the least, not exactly on the friendliest terms with us. We should start negotiations with them, in order to establish more amicable relations, if we hope to keep them in our alliance. Of course, if we go through with this, we'll probably end up losing territory..."

AUS_ww1_give_italy_territories:0 "Give South Tyrol and Istria"
AUS_ww1_give_italy_territories_descn:0 "The Italians have made their demands clear: The historically Italian region of Istria, as well as a concession around the city of Split on the Dalmatian coast. Unfortunately, this is all coastal territory, but it might be a price worth paying to keeep Italy aligned with the Central Powers." 

AUS_ww1_italy_honnor_pact:0 "Call Italy to War"
AUS_ww1_italy_honnor_pact_desc:0 "Italy is now essentially forced to join up in a war with us. If we've send them territory and promised them more from France for nothing, their people will give the government hell. Now that things have broken out, it's time to collect our dues for handing out some of our prized regions."


 AUS_ww1_assert_position_east:0 "Assert Position in the East "
 AUS_ww1_assert_position_east_desc:0 "The position of the Central Powers in the East is the same- weaken Russia, and build hegemony in the region. As war with Russia in particular seems to be nearly inevitable, due to the Balkan situation, this is an effective course of action to take, though will drive France and Russia closer, which could prove to be an issue."

 AUS_ww1_anti_ru:0 "Anti-Russian Policy"
 AUS_ww1_anti_ru_desc:0 "To make good on our position, we shall sever most diplomatic ties with Russia, and begin to publicly work against them. This will likely do little but anger them for now, but it will open to us a host of options to deal with them in the future."

 AUS_ww1_anti_ru_limit_trade:0 "Limit Trade with Russia"
 AUS_ww1_anti_ru_limit_trade_desc:0 "Russia is one of our major trade partners, and we are in a fortunate position where they need us more than we need them. By placing sanctions and tariffs on Russian products, we can ensure that we get an edge over them economically."

 AUS_ww1_rom:0 "Romanian Rapprochement"
 AUS_ww1_rom_desc:0 "The Romanians are a thorn in our side. We control a large portion of their territory, and though they're officially a minor member of the Triple Alliance, there is no doubt that they eye our territory with envy. We should extend good tidings out to them, to try and get them back closer to the winning team. Of course, to truly win them over might take concession..."

 AUS_ww1_rom_give_bucovina:0 "Give Bucovina to Romania"
 AUS_ww1_rom_give_bucovina_desc:0 "Bucovina is not a significant amount of territory, but it's some of the most Romanian land in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Conceding this territory is not guaranteed to win their heart, but it's certainly worth making an offer- we're a lot better off with a solid ally than a few inches of land."

 AUS_ww1_rom_honnor_pact:0 "Call Romania to War"
 AUS_ww1_rom_honnor_pact_desc:0 "Since Romania accepted our offer of Bucovina, we are in a good position to call them into the current conflict. There is no doubt that if they decline, their people will be most displeased with them."

 AUS_ww1_oirganization_realm:0 "Organize the Realm"
 AUS_ww1_oirganization_realm_desc:0 "Austria-Hungary, as a collection of parts of old kingdoms, is not in a great defensive position. Despite this, however, we can fortify and entrench our troops, to try and hold back the brunt of an offense on any of our broad borders." 

 AUS_ww1_fortify_russian_borders:0 "Fortify Russian Borders"
 AUS_ww1_fortify_russian_borders_desc:0 "The Galician region is one of keen strategic interest, and keeping the Russians out is important if we want to keep an advantage in the East. A fortification line in that region will help beat back the bear."

 AUS_ww1_airport_russian_borders:0 "Build Airports near Russian Borders"
 AUS_ww1_airport_russian_borders_desc:0 "The advent of combat aeroplanes may very well be a deciding factor in the war in the East. If we build airstrips out this way early and well, we can host more planes in the region, making it a more likely prospect to break enemy air superiority and, by extension, win crucial battles in the region."

 AUS_ww1_fortify_italian_borders:0 "Fortify Italian Borders"
 AUS_ww1_fortify_italian_borders_desc:0 "The Italian border is long and oddly curved, making it difficult for units to support each other. Worse yet, the Italians themselves are entrenched at the bottoms of mountain chains and in fortified urban areas. Since we are unlikely to break into it any time soon, we must be sure that we can at the very least defend from that direction."

 AUS_ww1_fortify_bosnia_borders:0 "Fortify Balkans Borders"
 AUS_ww1_fortify_bosnia_borders_desc:0 "It is highly unlikely that the Balkans will give us serious issues, but it is always better to be safe than sorry, lest French marines arriving in the region give us a rude awakening. It will also deny Serbia and Montenegro the chance to attack into our territory to any degree, further making for a safe Balkan campaign."

 AUS_ww1_fortify_coast_dalmatia:0 "Fortify the Dalmatian Coast"
 AUS_ww1_fortify_coast_dalmatia_desc:0 "Though we don't have a very strong navy, we still posess a long coastline, which must be defended if a front from the Balkans to Italy is not to be established, which would be a disaster for our war effort. Improving existing coastal forts and construction of new ones can help make sure that we never have to face that nightmare scenario."

 AUS_ww1_balkans_policy_intervene:0 "First Balkan War Reaction"
 AUS_ww1_balkans_policy_intervene_desc:0 "The Balkan War was an interesting experience, particularly from showing the surprising potential strength of these Balkan states when unified.

 AUS_ww1_balkans_bulgaria_send_troops_desc:0 "To ensure Bulgaria at least has a fighting chance not to get annexed, we can send in some of our own troops, nominally volunteers, to try and give Bulgaria at least some edge in the conflict. This will provide some much-needed experience, and keep pushing Bulgaria more into our corner."

 AUS_ww1_balkans_serbian_expansion:0 "Investigate Serbian Expansionism"
 AUS_ww1_balkans_serbian_expansion_desc:0 "Though the Serbians were once allied to our state, since we've annexed Bosnia, things have been much less friendly betwen the Serbian government.

 AUS_ww1_annex_BOS_desc:0 "Bosnia has been technically a part of our realm since 1908, though the process of completely establishing it in our empire has, to this point, been so slow that they still have some measure of autonomy within our realm here years later. This state of affairs benefits no one. Of course, the question now becomes ''Will Austria, Hungary, or perhaps both rule this state?''"

 AUS_ww1_Schutzkorps:0 "Form More Schutzkorps"
 AUS_ww1_Schutzkorps_desc:0 "The Schutzkorps was an auxiliary volunteer militia established by Austro-Hungarian authorities in the newly annexed province of Bosnia and Herzegovina to track down Bosnian Serb opposition."
