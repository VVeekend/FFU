The only response is a preemptive strike! The Schlieffen Plan condones an attack through Belgium, though this would be relieved if we additionally invaded through the Netherlands. The United Kingdom nominally backs Belgium, however, surely those cowards won't actually declare war on us in case of invasion. What should we do, Seiner Majestät?"
