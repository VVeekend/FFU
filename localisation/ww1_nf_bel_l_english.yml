BEL_political_effort:0 "Political Effort" #link me pls
 BEL_ww1_political_effort_desc:0 "The time for reform is now. While the nation has been fine under the guidance of the system of old for years, these turbulent times require a government that is in position to respond to them. Whether we choose to change our ways as a nation, or bolster our existing government to stand up to new external threats, political change can do nothing but benefit our nation and people's future."


 BEL_ww1_sovereignist_ethos:0 "Centralization"
 BEL_ww1_sovereignist_ethos_desc:0 "The authority of the state has been too split for too long. By reducing the powers of our substates compared to our central government, we will overcome regionalism and factionalism to make a stronger nation, which will inevitably open the door to enact further measures."

 BEL_ww1_monarchy:0 "Authoritarianism Focus"
 BEL_ww1_monarchy_desc:0 "The powers exercised by the parliament and people can be dangerous. The only true way to keep control of our nation, particularly in such trying times, would be to adopt a generally authoritarian position, and rule over our country as it's meant to be ruled."

 BEL_ww1_democracy:0 "Democratic Focus"
 BEL_ww1_democracy_desc:0 "It is said that any ruler, at their core, derives their power from the people. If we make a move towards a more democratic society, even if we don't become one ourselves, we can at the very least fall into a much nicer position to trade with the various democratic nations around the world." 

 BEL_ww1_centralizedpower:0 "Labor Program"
 BEL_ww1_centralizedpower_desc:0 "In a time of war, or those immediately before or after, everyone has a job to do for their nation. If we put drifters, the homeless, and all of the other moochers who can't get a job to work on building for us, we can establish new manufacturies for nearly no cost, and the factory can even hire from the same labor pool if need be."

 BEL_ww1_freespeech:0 "Free Speech"
 BEL_ww1_freespeech_desc:0 "By giving the people the right to free speech and demonstration, we ensure that, at the very least, people can get their anger and stances out in a more creative way. Anybody who shouts ''FIRE!'' in a crowded movie theater, or uses any explitive to describe the Head of State's mother, is still going to prison." 

 BEL_ww1_reorganization_act:0 "Reorganization Act"
 BEL_ww1_reorganization_act_desc:0 "Much of our territory has been under the possession of various groups and individuals since civilization came to our humble nation. Over hundreds of years, however, much of this territory has been inefficiently laid out or used. By reorganizing the land and owners of our nation, particularly those that have been dormant, we can squeeze some of the newly displaced people into our factories."

 BEL_ww1_limited_rearmament:0 "Limited Rationing"
 BEL_ww1_limited_rearmament_desc:0 "With food shortages seemingly a fact of life in the near future, it's important that no one hogs more than their fair share of goods. Of course, with limited rationing, civilians will still be able to enjoy themselves- possibly at the expense of our military members, however."

 BEL_ww1_full_rearmament:0 "Harsh Rationing"
 BEL_ww1_full_rearmament_desc:0 "With our brave heroes actively defending the nation, they should have top priority for food and materials! Of course, the civilian population may resort to literally counting their beans and we might have a more restless population on our hands because of it, but if nothing else, our boys in uniform won't go hungry anytime soon." 



 BEL_ww1_collectivist_ethos:0 "Anti-Establishment Politics" #link me pls
 BEL_ww1_collectivist_ethos_desc:0 "The old state is doomed to fall, taking our country with it unless we are to take extreme measures. By adopting a harsher stance, and moving our country towards a more extreme government form, we'll be able to protect ourselves and our national interests effectively in today's world."

 BEL_ww1_nationalism_focus:0 "Nationalism Focus"
 BEL_ww1_nationalism_focus_desc:0 "National pride for our great home country is swelling thanks to recent events. Some of our country's political experts have even come up with a new form of government, known as Fascism, which may take root in our nation. Perhaps this government form could lead our esteemed empire to further glory!"

 BEL_ww1_militarism:0 "Militarism"
 BEL_ww1_militarism_desc:0 "Our growing military is becoming more and more a part of our nation's daily life. Luckily, popular support is favoring our troops currently, seeing them as the heroes fighting for our banner that they are. This military culture we are establishing is only furthering the cause of our armed forces."

 BEL_ww1_military_youth:0 "Military Youth"
 BEL_ww1_military_youth_desc:0 "Our militaristic culture must even be present with the children! By drilling respect for the military, and even offering training to the younger generations, we can ensure that they grow up to enlist to serve our glorious regime. Some might call this exploitation, but it sounds better when you say you're giving teenagers a bright future."

 BEL_ww1_paramilitarism:0 "Paramilitarism"
 BEL_ww1_paramilitarism_desc:0 "Some nations are foolish enough to condemn armed civilian groups, for fear of rebellion. However, if we are careful to restrict these ad-hoc militias to loyalists to the regime, we can create yet another group of angry men with guns who support our nation, which could do us well in case of war."

 BEL_ww1_internationalism_focus:0 "Internationalism Focus"
 BEL_ww1_internationalism_focus_desc:0 "The Communist Revolution cannot be stopped. It is better that our people embrace it and embrace it now, than have a civil war for it later. Once we openly begin our support for the Internationalist Communist Movement, we shall become as red as the blood of man."

 BEL_ww1_political_correctness:0 "Political Correctness"
 BEL_ww1_political_correctness_desc:0 "Anyone who speaks out against our movement is clearly doing it as a hate crime towards the people we support with it. Therefore, anyone who speaks out the regime is to be closely watched, and, perhaps, unpersoned."

 BEL_ww1_indoctrination:0 "Indoctrination"
 BEL_ww1_indoctrination_desc:0 "After many years of debate on how to get rowdy anti-communist citizens to finally support our wonderful new regime, some of the men on the Worker's Council suggested the establishment of a new ''Ministry of Love'', which, officially, humanely persuades people to understand why they should support our government. We don't talk about what happens unofficially in there."

 BEL_ww1_political_commissars:0 "Political Commissars"
 BEL_ww1_political_commissars_desc:0 "The military, ironically, is a place where anti-communist support thrives. By ensuring that our loving government has eyes everywhere, we can root out the dissent from these groups before it can rise."

 BEL_ww1_unitedpeople:0 "Patriotic Fervor"
 BEL_ww1_unitedpeople_desc:0 "A motivated populace can do great things! By inspiring our people to rally around our sacred banner, we can easily win their hearts and minds, and string them along for, well, anything we want to do, really, so long as we have a reasonable enough opposing force to look like the good guys."

 BEL_ww1_massive_effort:0 "Massive Effort"
 BEL_ww1_massive_effort_desc:0 "Every man and woman must help our nation's efforts! With the spectre of the Great War floating over all, a great program has been undertaken to build up our industrial capacity to help us overcome our most hated rivals!"

 BEL_ww1_fortify_city:0 "Civil Fortifications"
 BEL_ww1_fortify_city_desc:0 "When the fight comes to our borders, it's best to be prepared. By hiring construction workers to build up fortresses and bunkers on some of our outer provinces, we can safely hold off any enemy who dares attack us!"

 BEL_ww1_fortify_coast:0 "Coastal Defense"
 BEL_ww1_fortify_coast_desc:0 "A coastline is not an easy thing to defend. With ships able to land troops nearly anywhere coastal in our nation, Coastal Forts, which can help against marine invasions, are no difficult building to construct, and will help throw our enemies back into the ocean from whence they came."
