GER_ww1_support_boer:0 "Reinforce Deutsch-Südwestafrika"
GER_ww1_support_boer_desc:0 "DSWA, also known as Namibia, is one of Germany's most important colonies. Ensuring that it's defensible in an attack could serve to help out our nation's war efforts if it came down to it, and this would only take minor investment."

GER_ww1_support_boer_war:0 "Boer Revolt"
GER_ww1_support_boer_war_desc:0 "The Boers of South Africa are still only recently conquered, and not adjusted to British rule quite yet. If we supply and train some of the Boers who seek independence from the UK, they may be able to rise up against South African officials, giving us a rare advantage in a mostly Entente-controlled region of the world."

GER_ww1_assert_position_east_desc:0 "The position of the Central Powers in the East is the same- weaken Russia, and build hegemony in the region.

GER_ww1_hol_militaryaccess:0 "Ask The Netherlands for Military Access"
GER_ww1_hol_militaryaccess_desc:0 "Obviously, a war in Belgium will be more favorable for us if we can pass through the Netherlands, which would also give us an easy place to retreat to in case a battle went bad.

GER_endthenavalarmsracewiththeunitedkingdom_desc:0 "In 1912, German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg ended the naval arms race. His aim was to secure an understanding with the British to end the increasingly isolated position of Germany. Russian military expansion compelled the Germans to prioritize spending on their army and therefore less on the navy. The initiative led to the Haldane Mission in which Germany offered to accept British naval superiority in exchange for British neutrality in a war in which Germany could not be said to be the aggressor. The proposal was rejected, as Britain felt that it had nothing to gain by such a treaty since its naval superiority was insecure, but the British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey favoured a more assertive policy against Germany.["

They were similar in displacement, armament and cost to battleships, but differed slightly in form and balance of attributes. Battlecruisers typically had slightly thinner armour and a lighter main gun battery than contemporary battleships, installed on a longer hull with much higher engine power in order to attain greater speeds."

GER_reinforcethekaiserlichemarine_desc:0 "Arms race between Great Britain and Germany that occurred from the last decade of the nineteenth century until the advent of World War I in 1914 was one of the intertwined causes of that conflict. While based in a bilateral relationship that had worsened over many decades, the arms race began with a plan by German Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz in 1897 to create a fleet in being to force Britain to make diplomatic concessions; Tirpitz did not expect the Imperial German Navy to defeat the Royal Navy. Maintaining Europe's largest army and second-largest navy took an enormous toll on Germany's finances. Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, German Chancellor from 1909, undertook a policy of détente with Britain to alleviate the fiscal strain and focus on the rivalry with France. Under Bethmann-Hollweg, and particularly from 1912 onwards, Germany abandoned the dreadnought arms race and focused on a commerce raiding naval strategy to be conducted with submarines. One of the ironies of the arms race and subsequent conflict was that while the German battle fleet fought only one major surface engagement, at the Battle of Jutland, and never seriously threatened British naval supremacy, the commerce raiding strategy that had been the historic focus of German naval doctrine would consistently endanger British merchant shipping and imports throughout the war."

The continued series of actions lasted the majority of the campaigning season for 1915, starting in early May and only ending due to bad weather in October."
