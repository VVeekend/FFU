 # [Generic] Industrial Effort

 BEL_ww1_industrial_effort:0 "Industrial Effort"
 BEL_ww1_industrial_effort_desc:0 "The Industrial Era is still well underway, and our nation still has work to do to stay ahead. Beginning some ambitious new projects to increase our industrial capacity will have short and long term benefits to our nation, not the least of which shall be our vastly improved ability to equip a military."

 BEL_ww1_construction_effort:0 "Construction Effort"
 BEL_ww1_construction_effort_desc:0 "A foreign company from a nearby neutral nation has been acquired in a merger with one of our national industries. If we encourage the new branch to move their factories and jobs to our country, we will see an immediate boost to our Civilian manufacturing sector. Of course, we'll have to cover the construction of the new plants..."

 BEL_ww1_construction_effort_2:0 "Construction Effort II"
 BEL_ww1_construction_effort_2_desc:0 "Sometimes, even in a free market, the state must become involved. If we are to start new companies on the Government's budget, and build up new factories appropriately, we can ensure that we stay competitive and independent of foreign products in a time when trade might become more and more difficult." 

 BEL_ww1_construction_effort_3:0 "Construction Effort III"
 BEL_ww1_construction_effort_3_desc:0 "Our Civilian Industrial expansion is nearly complete, but there's still more that we can do. Some extra land inside of a city we own can be sold to one of our corporations, under the agreement that they'll build a factory there. This will even further increase our Civilian goods output, and leave us with few options for more beyond simple construction."

 BEL_ww1_production_effort:0 "Armament Effort"
 BEL_ww1_production_effort_desc:0 "The amount of weapons we have been purchasing has attracted the eye of a local Steel magnate, who wants to start a new firearm manufacturing company in our nation. If we sponsor this endeavor, by helping him acquire land, investors, and talent, we will reap the obvious benefit of a brand new Military factory."

 BEL_ww1_production_effort_2:0 "Armament Effort II"
 BEL_ww1_production_effort_2_desc:0 "A car company which has been previously making military-grade vehicles for us is showing interest in creating a brand new factory simply for military production, in order to retain its ability to supply to the Civilian market. If we spring for construction of this plant, we could negotiate an exclusivity deal, which would simply mean a direct increase in our military equipment output."

 BEL_ww1_production_effort_3:0 "Armament Effort III"
 BEL_ww1_production_effort_3_desc:0 "An Airplane designer and mechanic has approached us with a request to help him set up a brand new factory to produce his planes for our nation's air force. While he's not particularly tested, if worst comes to worst we can just have his factory produce our old designs instead. Funding his plant and helping him establish a new company will increase our military industrial capacity."

 BEL_ww1_dockyard_effort_1:0 "Dockyard Expansion"
 BEL_ww1_dockyard_effort_1_desc:0 "By purchasing unused or underused seaside land and expanding on our existing infrastructure, we can expand our ship manufacturing capabilities." 

 BEL_ww1_dockyard_effort_2:0 "Dockyard Expansion II"
 BEL_ww1_dockyard_effort_2_desc:0 "Merchant sailors, Fishermen, and retired sailors from our own navy can use their talents from the sea to oversee brand new docks." 

 BEL_ww1_dockyard_effort_3:0 "Dockyard Expansion III"
 BEL_ww1_dockyard_effort_3_desc:0 "Some of our old commercial docks just aren't seeing much action anymore. With just a little refurbishing and investment, these could be easily converted for military use."

 BEL_ww1_airfield_expansion_1:0 "Airfield Expansion"
 BEL_ww1_airfield_expansion_1_desc:0 "Airfields have the luxury of only requiring an open stretch of land near a road network. Establishing fields here is work in itself, but could pay off." 

 BEL_ww1_airfield_expansion_2:0 "Airfield Expansion II"
 BEL_ww1_airfield_expansion_2_desc:0 "Some of the civilian airstrips from the days before military aviation are still around and mostly abandoned. We could buy them up for next to nothing, and use them for our own means."

 BEL_ww1_airfield_expansion_3:0 "Airfield Expansion III"
 BEL_ww1_airfield_expansion_3_desc:0 "Establishing proper airstrips near major cities can create easily supplied bases able to protect some of our most valuable areas."

 BEL_ww1_infrastructure_effort:0 "Infrastructure Effort"
 BEL_ww1_infrastructure_effort_desc:0 "Along with the growth of our industry, the private sector is demanding we increase our investment in infrastructure to help the state economy out. Until we do so, we're unlikely to get any more special opportunities for factory construction. Of course, infrastructure helps our nation as well, by increasing the speed and supply flow of our troops, so investing might not be such a bad plan." 

 BEL_ww1_infrastructure_effort_2:0 "Infrastructure Effort II"
 BEL_ww1_infrastructure_effort_2_desc:0 "With our industries, dockyards, and airstrips continuing to expand, there is still more to invest in. Currently, the logical step forward is railways, which we have largely ignored up to now. Investing to modernize these will help move supplies and men, as well as open up new areas to invest in our economy."

 BEL_ww1_infrastructure_effort_3:0 "Infrastructure Effort III"
 BEL_ww1_infrastructure_effort_3_desc:0 "With the threat of a great war, we must continaully invest in construction projects, to ensure our troops have the nicest looking railroads in the world." 

 BEL_ww1_infrastructure_effort_4:0 "Infrastructure Effort IV"
 BEL_ww1_infrastructure_effort_4_desc:0 "Some civil engineers have proposed a very ambitious Highway system, designed to connect more directly some of our major cities and even military centers. Investing in this project will make our infrastructure the envy of the world! All roads shall lead to our capital!"

 BEL_ww1_extra_tech_slot:0 "Extra Research Slot"
 BEL_ww1_extra_tech_slot_desc:0 "With a greatly expanded industrial sector and several of our country's leading minds at the helms of new manufacturies of both military and civil R&D inevitably will result. Some of the industries we have prior supported have produced and exposed some keen-minded individuals, who can develop interesting new technologies for our nation."

 BEL_ww1_extra_tech_slot_2:0 "Extra Research Slot II"
 BEL_ww1_extra_tech_slot_2_desc:0 "Our great investment in infrastructure and industry has made our country smaller- not on the map, thank god, but in the sense of bring everyone together. Some bright minds from more obscure parts of our nation are visiting our capital more often, and it would not be particularly difficult to get them in the service of our nation."

 # [Generic] Naval Effort

 BEL_ww1_naval_effort:0 "Modernize the Navy" #link me pls
 BEL_ww1_naval_effort_desc:0 "Combustion-powered ships have begun to shine above their contemporaries, and have heralded yet another new era of naval warfare. Huge ships with equally large guns fighting at incredible engagement ranges is slated to be the order of the day. Due to this, a modernization program for our ships, as well as training in the new ways of warfare for our officers, is most certainly in order."

 BEL_ww1_newnavalcanons_1:0 "Naval Gun Effort"
 BEL_ww1_newnavalcanons_1_desc:0 "While our ship designs themselves are constantly evolving, we cannot forget about the guns aboard our vessels. Though we've been standardizing calibers for over a century now, we still have far too many different variable gun sizes for far too many roles. By cutting the total amount of standards, and making each type of gun more general-purpose, we can streamline ship design."

 BEL_ww1_newnavalcanons_2:0 "Naval Gun Effort II"
 BEL_ww1_newnavalcanons_2_desc:0 "Though we have now solved the problems of the guns themselves, we must also stay up to date with equipment that supports our naval batteries. Rangefinders are starting to become a common feature of our ships, and ensuring that our officers know how to use it, especially compared to our guns' maximum effective range, will make battling a much smoother process, and help us get more use out of our newer, better guns."

 BEL_ww1_newnavalcanons_3:0 "Naval Gun Effort III"
 BEL_ww1_newnavalcanons_3_desc:0 "Analogue Fire Control is making a splash in the naval community, for its ability to guide all guns of a ship onto the same rough target. While still relatively primitive, obviously ship and gun designs with the ability to utilize such a feature are already in high demand. These new designs can further give us a techonological edge on the sea."

 BEL_ww1_dreadnought_effort:0 "Dreadnought Effort"
 BEL_ww1_dreadnought_effort_desc:0 "Since the British first unveiled the Dreadnought-class, an arms race has been in progress between the major navies of the world to produce the biggest, best battleships. If our country is to stay relevant in today's naval war, we must bring out improved designs for these ships of our own."

 BEL_ww1_flexible_navy:0 "Flexible Navy"
 BEL_ww1_flexible_navy_desc:0 "A great mass of ships is of no use to us if they're only patrolling a very small amount of the ocean. Building a fleet which can go anywhere, any time it's needed, with large amounts of screens supported by decent numbers of Battleships and Dreadnoughts, could help us control more of the sea and respond to a larger variety of threats, allowing us to project power all across the world."

 BEL_ww1_large_navy:0 "Large Navy"
 BEL_ww1_large_navy_desc:0 "Having just Battleships and Dreadnoughts would be formidible on its own, but also creating a solid core of screens and battlecruisers can easily tip the seas in our favor from both the tactical options such crafts give us, as well as sheer number. If we build around this concept and study the doctrine to match, our fleet may just become unbeatable."

 BEL_ww1_navyreform:0 "Navy Deployment"
 BEL_ww1_navyreform_desc:0 "It is not simply guns and ships that win a naval battle. The best vessel in the world is no good if it's not on the sea at the right time and at the right place. Investing in more direct communication channels both ship-to-ship and ship-to-port can help us ensure that a ship will be at precisely the right place at precisely the right time, assisting in our attempts at naval supremacy." 

 BEL_ww1_cruiser_effort:0 "Cruiser Effort"
 BEL_ww1_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Our admirals desire a larger amount and investment in Cruisers, to give us medium-sized ships good for harassing smaller vessels, enemy cargo ships, and supporting larger warships. Sending out for shipwrights to propose and build advanced designs of this ship class will help us against any enemy with a large, Destroyer-focused fleet, and help our Submarines stay out of danger."

 BEL_ww1_destroyer_effort:0 "Destroyer Effort"
 BEL_ww1_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "Our admirals have requested a larger amount and investment in Destroyers, to give us light ships good for taking out submarines, scouting for the rest of the fleet, and escorting Convoys. Ordering more and better Destroyers in our dockyards will help us keep our trade routes open, and Submarines well out and away." 

 BEL_ww1_capital_ships_effort:0 "Capital Ship Effort"
 BEL_ww1_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "Our admirals have given a simple demand: More of these amazing Dreadnoughts, and bigger and better ones as well. Constructing these behemoth ships will help us take control of the waters, give fire support to troops fighting on the shores, and protect our naval invasions to start with. "

 BEL_ww1_carrier_focus:0 "Carrier Focus"
 BEL_ww1_carrier_focus_desc:0 "A few radical minds have proposed a nearly unarmed ship, simply used for hosting an array of naval bombers. This is a very promising project, even if it is a bit hindered by the technology of today. If we are to pursue this project, perhaps planes will one day become a common sight even over the waters." 

 BEL_ww1_antisubmarine:0 "Anti-Submarine Warfare"
 BEL_ww1_antisubmarine_desc:0 "Submarines are a tricky vessel to catch, particularly when well-commandeered. If we don't intend to let all of our incoming cargo ships sink to the bottom of the ocean, our admirals have advised us to begin investing in depth charges, advanced torpedos, and other weapons that might be able to take out the unseen menace."
