 # [Generic] Industrial Effort

 ww1_industrial_effort:0 "Industrial Effort"
 ww1_industrial_effort_desc:0 "The Industrial Era is still well underway, and our nation still has work to do to stay ahead. Beginning some ambitious new projects to increase our industrial capacity will have short and long term benefits to our nation, not the least of which shall be our vastly improved ability to equip a military."

 ww1_construction_effort:0 "Construction Effort"
 ww1_construction_effort_desc:0 "A foreign company from a nearby neutral nation has been acquired in a merger with one of our national industries. If we encourage the new branch to move their factories and jobs to our country, we will see an immediate boost to our Civilian manufacturing sector. Of course, we'll have to cover the construction of the new plants..."

 ww1_construction_effort_2:0 "Construction Effort II"
 ww1_construction_effort_2_desc:0 "Sometimes, even in a free market, the state must become involved. If we are to start new companies on the Government's budget, and build up new factories appropriately, we can ensure that we stay competitive and independent of foreign products in a time when trade might become more and more difficult." 

 ww1_construction_effort_3:0 "Construction Effort III"
 ww1_construction_effort_3_desc:0 "Our Civilian Industrial expansion is nearly complete, but there's still more that we can do. Some extra land inside of a city we own can be sold to one of our corporations, under the agreement that they'll build a factory there. This will even further increase our Civilian goods output, and leave us with few options for more beyond simple construction."

 ww1_production_effort:0 "Armament Effort"
 ww1_production_effort_desc:0 "The amount of weapons we have been purchasing has attracted the eye of a local Steel magnate, who wants to start a new firearm manufacturing company in our nation. If we sponsor this endeavor, by helping him acquire land, investors, and talent, we will reap the obvious benefit of a brand new Military factory."

 ww1_production_effort_2:0 "Armament Effort II"
 ww1_production_effort_2_desc:0 "A car company which has been previously making military-grade vehicles for us is showing interest in creating a brand new factory simply for military production, in order to retain its ability to supply to the Civilian market. If we spring for construction of this plant, we could negotiate an exclusivity deal, which would simply mean a direct increase in our military equipment output."

 ww1_production_effort_3:0 "Armament Effort III"
 ww1_production_effort_3_desc:0 "An Airplane designer and mechanic has approached us with a request to help him set up a brand new factory to produce his planes for our nation's air force. While he's not particularly tested, if worst comes to worst we can just have his factory produce our old designs instead. Funding his plant and helping him establish a new company will increase our military industrial capacity."

 ww1_dockyard_effort_1:0 "Dockyard Expansion"
 ww1_dockyard_effort_1_desc:0 "By purchasing unused or underused seaside land and expanding on our existing infrastructure, we can expand our ship manufacturing capabilities." 

 ww1_dockyard_effort_2:0 "Dockyard Expansion II"
 ww1_dockyard_effort_2_desc:0 "Merchant sailors, Fishermen, and retired sailors from our own navy can use their talents from the sea to oversee brand new docks." 

 ww1_dockyard_effort_3:0 "Dockyard Expansion III"
 ww1_dockyard_effort_3_desc:0 "Some of our old commercial docks just aren't seeing much action anymore. With just a little refurbishing and investment, these could be easily converted for military use."

 ww1_airfield_expansion_1:0 "Airfield Expansion"
 ww1_airfield_expansion_1_desc:0 "Airfields have the luxury of only requiring an open stretch of land near a road network. Establishing fields here is work in itself, but could pay off." 

 ww1_airfield_expansion_2:0 "Airfield Expansion II"
 ww1_airfield_expansion_2_desc:0 "Some of the civilian airstrips from the days before military aviation are still around and mostly abandoned. We could buy them up for next to nothing, and use them for our own means."

 ww1_airfield_expansion_3:0 "Airfield Expansion III"
 ww1_airfield_expansion_3_desc:0 "Establishing proper airstrips near major cities can create easily supplied bases able to protect some of our most valuable areas."

 ww1_infrastructure_effort:0 "Infrastructure Effort"
 ww1_infrastructure_effort_desc:0 "Along with the growth of our industry, the private sector is demanding we increase our investment in infrastructure to help the state economy out. Until we do so, we're unlikely to get any more special opportunities for factory construction. Of course, infrastructure helps our nation as well, by increasing the speed and supply flow of our troops, so investing might not be such a bad plan." 

 ww1_infrastructure_effort_2:0 "Infrastructure Effort II"
 ww1_infrastructure_effort_2_desc:0 "With our industries, dockyards, and airstrips continuing to expand, there is still more to invest in. Currently, the logical step forward is railways, which we have largely ignored up to now. Investing to modernize these will help move supplies and men, as well as open up new areas to invest in our economy."

 ww1_infrastructure_effort_3:0 "Infrastructure Effort III"
 ww1_infrastructure_effort_3_desc:0 "With the threat of a great war, we must continaully invest in construction projects, to ensure our troops have the nicest looking railroads in the world." 

 ww1_infrastructure_effort_4:0 "Infrastructure Effort IV"
 ww1_infrastructure_effort_4_desc:0 "Some civil engineers have proposed a very ambitious Highway system, designed to connect more directly some of our major cities and even military centers. Investing in this project will make our infrastructure the envy of the world! All roads shall lead to our capital!"

 ww1_extra_tech_slot:0 "Extra Research Slot"
 ww1_extra_tech_slot_desc:0 "With a greatly expanded industrial sector and several of our country's leading minds at the helms of new manufacturies of both military and civil R&D inevitably will result. Some of the industries we have prior supported have produced and exposed some keen-minded individuals, who can develop interesting new technologies for our nation."

 ww1_extra_tech_slot_2:0 "Extra Research Slot II"
 ww1_extra_tech_slot_2_desc:0 "Our great investment in infrastructure and industry has made our country smaller- not on the map, thank god, but in the sense of bring everyone together. Some bright minds from more obscure parts of our nation are visiting our capital more often, and it would not be particularly difficult to get them in the service of our nation."

 # [Generic] Naval Effort

 ww1_naval_effort:0 "Modernize the Navy" #link me pls
 ww1_naval_effort_desc:0 "Combustion-powered ships have begun to shine above their contemporaries, and have heralded yet another new era of naval warfare. Huge ships with equally large guns fighting at incredible engagement ranges is slated to be the order of the day. Due to this, a modernization program for our ships, as well as training in the new ways of warfare for our officers, is most certainly in order."

 ww1_newnavalcanons_1:0 "Naval Gun Effort"
 ww1_newnavalcanons_1_desc:0 "While our ship designs themselves are constantly evolving, we cannot forget about the guns aboard our vessels. Though we've been standardizing calibers for over a century now, we still have far too many different variable gun sizes for far too many roles. By cutting the total amount of standards, and making each type of gun more general-purpose, we can streamline ship design."

 ww1_newnavalcanons_2:0 "Naval Gun Effort II"
 ww1_newnavalcanons_2_desc:0 "Though we have now solved the problems of the guns themselves, we must also stay up to date with equipment that supports our naval batteries. Rangefinders are starting to become a common feature of our ships, and ensuring that our officers know how to use it, especially compared to our guns' maximum effective range, will make battling a much smoother process, and help us get more use out of our newer, better guns."

 ww1_newnavalcanons_3:0 "Naval Gun Effort III"
 ww1_newnavalcanons_3_desc:0 "Analogue Fire Control is making a splash in the naval community, for its ability to guide all guns of a ship onto the same rough target. While still relatively primitive, obviously ship and gun designs with the ability to utilize such a feature are already in high demand. These new designs can further give us a techonological edge on the sea."

 ww1_dreadnought_effort:0 "Dreadnought Effort"
 ww1_dreadnought_effort_desc:0 "Since the British first unveiled the Dreadnought-class, an arms race has been in progress between the major navies of the world to produce the biggest, best battleships. If our country is to stay relevant in today's naval war, we must bring out improved designs for these ships of our own."

 ww1_flexible_navy:0 "Flexible Navy"
 ww1_flexible_navy_desc:0 "A great mass of ships is of no use to us if they're only patrolling a very small amount of the ocean. Building a fleet which can go anywhere, any time it's needed, with large amounts of screens supported by decent numbers of Battleships and Dreadnoughts, could help us control more of the sea and respond to a larger variety of threats, allowing us to project power all across the world."

 ww1_large_navy:0 "Large Navy"
 ww1_large_navy_desc:0 "Having just Battleships and Dreadnoughts would be formidible on its own, but also creating a solid core of screens and battlecruisers can easily tip the seas in our favor from both the tactical options such crafts give us, as well as sheer number. If we build around this concept and study the doctrine to match, our fleet may just become unbeatable."

 ww1_navyreform:0 "Navy Deployment"
 ww1_navyreform_desc:0 "It is not simply guns and ships that win a naval battle. The best vessel in the world is no good if it's not on the sea at the right time and at the right place. Investing in more direct communication channels both ship-to-ship and ship-to-port can help us ensure that a ship will be at precisely the right place at precisely the right time, assisting in our attempts at naval supremacy." 

 ww1_cruiser_effort:0 "Cruiser Effort"
 ww1_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Our admirals desire a larger amount and investment in Cruisers, to give us medium-sized ships good for harassing smaller vessels, enemy cargo ships, and supporting larger warships. Sending out for shipwrights to propose and build advanced designs of this ship class will help us against any enemy with a large, Destroyer-focused fleet, and help our Submarines stay out of danger."

 ww1_destroyer_effort:0 "Destroyer Effort"
 ww1_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "Our admirals have requested a larger amount and investment in Destroyers, to give us light ships good for taking out submarines, scouting for the rest of the fleet, and escorting Convoys. Ordering more and better Destroyers in our dockyards will help us keep our trade routes open, and Submarines well out and away." 

 ww1_capital_ships_effort:0 "Capital Ship Effort"
 ww1_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "Our admirals have given a simple demand: More of these amazing Dreadnoughts, and bigger and better ones as well. Constructing these behemoth ships will help us take control of the waters, give fire support to troops fighting on the shores, and protect our naval invasions to start with. "

 ww1_carrier_focus:0 "Carrier Focus"
 ww1_carrier_focus_desc:0 "A few radical minds have proposed a nearly unarmed ship, simply used for hosting an array of naval bombers. This is a very promising project, even if it is a bit hindered by the technology of today. If we are to pursue this project, perhaps planes will one day become a common sight even over the waters." 

 ww1_antisubmarine:0 "Anti-Submarine Warfare"
 ww1_antisubmarine_desc:0 "Submarines are a tricky vessel to catch, particularly when well-commandeered. If we don't intend to let all of our incoming cargo ships sink to the bottom of the ocean, our admirals have advised us to begin investing in depth charges, advanced torpedos, and other weapons that might be able to take out the unseen menace."

 # [Generic] Political Effort

 ww1_political_effort:0 "Political Effort" #link me pls
 ww1_political_effort_desc:0 "The time for reform is now. While the nation has been fine under the guidance of the system of old for years, these turbulent times require a government that is in position to respond to them. Whether we choose to change our ways as a nation, or bolster our existing government to stand up to new external threats, political change can do nothing but benefit our nation and people's future."


 ww1_sovereignist_ethos:0 "Centralization"
 ww1_sovereignist_ethos_desc:0 "The authority of the state has been too split for too long. By reducing the powers of our substates compared to our central government, we will overcome regionalism and factionalism to make a stronger nation, which will inevitably open the door to enact further measures."

 ww1_monarchy:0 "Authoritarianism Focus"
 ww1_monarchy_desc:0 "The powers exercised by the parliament and people can be dangerous. The only true way to keep control of our nation, particularly in such trying times, would be to adopt a generally authoritarian position, and rule over our country as it's meant to be ruled."

 ww1_democracy:0 "Democratic Focus"
 ww1_democracy_desc:0 "It is said that any ruler, at their core, derives their power from the people. If we make a move towards a more democratic society, even if we don't become one ourselves, we can at the very least fall into a much nicer position to trade with the various democratic nations around the world." 

 ww1_centralizedpower:0 "Labor Program"
 ww1_centralizedpower_desc:0 "In a time of war, or those immediately before or after, everyone has a job to do for their nation. If we put drifters, the homeless, and all of the other moochers who can't get a job to work on building for us, we can establish new manufacturies for nearly no cost, and the factory can even hire from the same labor pool if need be."

 ww1_freespeech:0 "Free Speech"
 ww1_freespeech_desc:0 "By giving the people the right to free speech and demonstration, we ensure that, at the very least, people can get their anger and stances out in a more creative way. Anybody who shouts ''FIRE!'' in a crowded movie theater, or uses any explitive to describe the Head of State's mother, is still going to prison." 

 ww1_reorganization_act:0 "Reorganization Act"
 ww1_reorganization_act_desc:0 "Much of our territory has been under the possession of various groups and individuals since civilization came to our humble nation. Over hundreds of years, however, much of this territory has been inefficiently laid out or used. By reorganizing the land and owners of our nation, particularly those that have been dormant, we can squeeze some of the newly displaced people into our factories."

 ww1_limited_rearmament:0 "Limited Rationing"
 ww1_limited_rearmament_desc:0 "With food shortages seemingly a fact of life in the near future, it's important that no one hogs more than their fair share of goods. Of course, with limited rationing, civilians will still be able to enjoy themselves- possibly at the expense of our military members, however."

 ww1_full_rearmament:0 "Harsh Rationing"
 ww1_full_rearmament_desc:0 "With our brave heroes actively defending the nation, they should have top priority for food and materials! Of course, the civilian population may resort to literally counting their beans and we might have a more restless population on our hands because of it, but if nothing else, our boys in uniform won't go hungry anytime soon." 



 ww1_collectivist_ethos:0 "Anti-Establishment Politics" #link me pls
 ww1_collectivist_ethos_desc:0 "The old state is doomed to fall, taking our country with it unless we are to take extreme measures. By adopting a harsher stance, and moving our country towards a more extreme government form, we'll be able to protect ourselves and our national interests effectively in today's world."

 ww1_nationalism_focus:0 "Nationalism Focus"
 ww1_nationalism_focus_desc:0 "National pride for our great home country is swelling thanks to recent events. Some of our country's political experts have even come up with a new form of government, known as Fascism, which may take root in our nation. Perhaps this government form could lead our esteemed empire to further glory!"

 ww1_militarism:0 "Militarism"
 ww1_militarism_desc:0 "Our growing military is becoming more and more a part of our nation's daily life. Luckily, popular support is favoring our troops currently, seeing them as the heroes fighting for our banner that they are. This military culture we are establishing is only furthering the cause of our armed forces."

 ww1_military_youth:0 "Military Youth"
 ww1_military_youth_desc:0 "Our militaristic culture must even be present with the children! By drilling respect for the military, and even offering training to the younger generations, we can ensure that they grow up to enlist to serve our glorious regime. Some might call this exploitation, but it sounds better when you say you're giving teenagers a bright future."

 ww1_paramilitarism:0 "Paramilitarism"
 ww1_paramilitarism_desc:0 "Some nations are foolish enough to condemn armed civilian groups, for fear of rebellion. However, if we are careful to restrict these ad-hoc militias to loyalists to the regime, we can create yet another group of angry men with guns who support our nation, which could do us well in case of war."

 ww1_internationalism_focus:0 "Internationalism Focus"
 ww1_internationalism_focus_desc:0 "The Communist Revolution cannot be stopped. It is better that our people embrace it and embrace it now, than have a civil war for it later. Once we openly begin our support for the Internationalist Communist Movement, we shall become as red as the blood of man."

 ww1_political_correctness:0 "Political Correctness"
 ww1_political_correctness_desc:0 "Anyone who speaks out against our movement is clearly doing it as a hate crime towards the people we support with it. Therefore, anyone who speaks out the regime is to be closely watched, and, perhaps, unpersoned."

 ww1_indoctrination:0 "Indoctrination"
 ww1_indoctrination_desc:0 "After many years of debate on how to get rowdy anti-communist citizens to finally support our wonderful new regime, some of the men on the Worker's Council suggested the establishment of a new ''Ministry of Love'', which, officially, humanely persuades people to understand why they should support our government. We don't talk about what happens unofficially in there."

 ww1_political_commissars:0 "Political Commissars"
 ww1_political_commissars_desc:0 "The military, ironically, is a place where anti-communist support thrives. By ensuring that our loving government has eyes everywhere, we can root out the dissent from these groups before it can rise."

 ww1_unitedpeople:0 "Patriotic Fervor"
 ww1_unitedpeople_desc:0 "A motivated populace can do great things! By inspiring our people to rally around our sacred banner, we can easily win their hearts and minds, and string them along for, well, anything we want to do, really, so long as we have a reasonable enough opposing force to look like the good guys."

 ww1_massive_effort:0 "Massive Effort"
 ww1_massive_effort_desc:0 "Every man and woman must help our nation's efforts! With the spectre of the Great War floating over all, a great program has been undertaken to build up our industrial capacity to help us overcome our most hated rivals!"

 ww1_fortify_city:0 "Civil Fortifications"
 ww1_fortify_city_desc:0 "When the fight comes to our borders, it's best to be prepared. By hiring construction workers to build up fortresses and bunkers on some of our outer provinces, we can safely hold off any enemy who dares attack us!"

 ww1_fortify_coast:0 "Coastal Defense"
 ww1_fortify_coast_desc:0 "A coastline is not an easy thing to defend. With ships able to land troops nearly anywhere coastal in our nation, Coastal Forts, which can help against marine invasions, are no difficult building to construct, and will help throw our enemies back into the ocean from whence they came."


 #--------------------------------------------------------------
 # [Generic] Diplomatic Effort

 ww1_diplomatic_effort:0 "Diplomatic Effort"
 ww1_diplomatic_effort_desc:0 "It is becoming increasingly difficult to stay in the middle of the affairs in the world as it stands. Our diplomatic corps is already asking if we're to be involved in the coming power struggle, or if we are to stay out of things entirely. While we can't answer that question quite yet, we can easily expand our corps to be able to choose one of these options."

 ww1_takeposition:0 "Take Position"
 ww1_takeposition_desc:0 "Our place in the world is tenuous at best. After all, with the great empires at each others' throats, what's to stop one from turning on us once they're through? We must bet on the winning horse, and quickly, to ensure ourselves a place at the council of victors instead of as a footnote in a history book."

 ww1_supportgermany:0 "Support Germany"
 ww1_supportgermany_desc:0 "With the German Empire's massive industrial sector, they seem to be the clear-cut bet, even if they are diplomatically isolated. Showing public support to the Germans on even a few, non-key matters will send a message that we're moving closer to the Central Powers."

 ww1_supportfrance:0 "Support France"
 ww1_supportfrance_desc:0 "Though France's industry can't compete with Germany's, they have far more friends, and we'd even be one more. By supporting France on in a few of the upcoming diplomatic issues, we may just win them over."

 ww1_supportaustria:0 "Support Austria-Hungary"
 ww1_supportaustria_desc:0 "The old empire of Austria-Hungary has lived to see the rise of most of the major nations on the world map. So, surely, if we want to become seen as a more major nation, what better country to support? This will also help us draw closer to the Central Powers." 

 ww1_supportrussia:0 "Support Russia"
 ww1_supportrussia_desc:0 "The Russian Empire is in pretty dire need of international help. For the nation whose former leader coined the term ''Sick Man of Russia'', they cannot be particularly healthy themselves. Our support will, if nothing else, help them hang on long enough to do something decisive."

 ww1_military_reserve:0 "Military Reserve"
 ww1_military_reserve_desc:0 "War could easily come to our borders at a moment's notice, and therefore, we have to be prepared for the worst. A Military Reserve of loosely trained conscripts will be of little true value in the case of a war, but these impressionable young men getting a taste of the army life may very easily convince them to join the real thing."

 ww1_embargo_germany:0 "Sanction Germany"
 ww1_embargo_germany_desc:0 "Germany's illegal Submarine attacks are an insult to free trade! Though a sanction will draw us slightly further from neutrality, it will make us far harder to exploit by the merchants of the German Empire."

 ww1_embargo_france:0 "Sanction France"
 ww1_embargo_france_desc:0 "France's diplomatic scheming and backstabbing are unforgivable! Though a sanction will make us appear and act far less neutral in the war situation, it's unlikely to spiral into anything bad, and more importantly, will ensure France cannot take advantage of us!" 

 ww1_sellweapons:0 "Sell Weapons"
 ww1_sellweapons_desc:0 "Though the tension of the world is the highest it's ever been, even this stormcloud has a silver lining. As we have no interest in joining the fight, we can easily hawk our weapons and weapon designs- even to both sides of a conflict, if we want- and make a killing off of the misfortunes of others. Their fault for starting the war."

 ww1_appeasement:0 "Appeasement"
 ww1_appeasement_desc:0 "Sometimes, flattery is the best way to save your own skin. Appeasing the larger powers is no prestigous action to have in your playbook, but if used at the right time, simply giving another nation what it wants can be a far lot safer than seeing what happens if you don't...so long as you remember to draw the line somewhere."

 ww1_aggressive_foreign_policy:0 "Aggressive Foreign Policy"
 ww1_aggressive_foreign_policy_desc:0 "Actually, you know what? On second thought, Neutrality is boring. To hell with it. We're ready to get involved in this war, and we're gonna come out swinging!"

 ww1_joingermany:0 "Join Central Powers"
 ww1_joingermany_desc:0 "The Central Powers have long been a friend to our nation, and desperately need help in these most uncertain times. Joining them is a one-way ticket into the war on their side, and we better be in it to win it if we are, but we could turn the tides to a decisive victory on their part."

 ww1_joinfrance:0 "Join Entente"
 ww1_joinfrance_desc:0 "The Entente currently seem to be in the better position to win the war, and we wouldn't want to be caught missing the peace conference once they do. Joining the Entente will definitely pull us into war, which could wind up disastrously, but at least we'll have allies to help, right?" 

 ww1_war_effort:0 "War Effort"
 ww1_war_effort_desc:0 "With the world in its current state, we can't afford to let other nations pass over our military. By expanding our industrial base, we can ensure we'll have enough guns and shells to come out on top."
